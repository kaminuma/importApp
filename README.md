Schedule bulk management application API

This application was created with the aim of being a web application that manages schedules all at once.
Bulk management not only allows you to manage each schedule manually, but also allows you to import schedules written in Excel or spreadsheets,
and update/delete registrations on the web by adding to that information. I am developing an application like this.

This repository is for that API
